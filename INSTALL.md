## How to install

1. Go to [the releases](https://github.com/Reginald-Gillespie/ClickGuardian/releases) page on github.
2. Download the latest zip file for your computer.
3. Unzip it wherever you like.
4. Edit the config.json as you like.
5. Run the program.

To install on a friend's computer, I suggest putting the unzipped program with the configurations you want on a flashdrive, then drag the folder from this to their computer when installing.
