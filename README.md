## Wait, Wut?

Ok, actually. ClickGuardian is a prank program designed to troll your friends and colleagues by tacking their mouse clicks and displaying a paywall when they surpass a configured limit. I recommend only blocking clicks for those who know how to use Task Manager.

You can configure whether the program actually blocks clicks, how long it takes for the "Remind Me Later" button to disappear, and more.


**Warning:** Insert general disclaimer in legalese saying how I am not responsible for anything harmful done with this, etc.
