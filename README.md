# Wait, Wut?

Ok, actually. ClickGuardian is a prank program designed to troll your friends and colleagues by tacking their mouse clicks and displaying a paywall when they surpass a configured limit. It is 100% free.

ClickGuardian can:
- Register itself to run at startup
- Count mouse clicks globally, per month
- Present a paywall
- Block clicks past the configured limit

<br>

Under `config.json`, you can change these fields:
- `ClickLimit` - The amount of clicks to allow per month.
- `GracePeriod` - The amount of clicks to allow after clicking "Remind Me Later". It would be very mean to set this to 0.
- `UnlockTime` - The time in milliseconds to delay after clicking "Remind Me Later"
- `BlockClicks` - Whether to actually block using the mouse.
- `ShowTrayIcon` - Whether to show the application icon in the tray.
- `ShowExitButton` - Whether to show a nice "Exit" button on the tray icon. Requires `ShowTrayIcon`.
- `RegisterForReboot` - Whether to rerun itself at next reboot.

## Install
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.


Just want to see what it looks like? Set the config to allow 5 clicks, run it, click 5 times.

**Warning:** Insert general disclaimer in legalese saying how I am not responsible for anything harmful done with this, etc.
